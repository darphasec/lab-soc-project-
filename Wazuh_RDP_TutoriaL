To monitor Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) logon attempts using Wazuh, follow these steps:

1. Install the Wazuh Agent on the Windows Endpoint:
   - Download the Wazuh agent installer for Windows.
   - Run the installer via Command Line Interface (CLI) or Graphical User Interface (GUI).
     - CLI Installation Example:
       ```cmd
       wazuh-agent-4.9.2-1.msi /q WAZUH_MANAGER="10.0.0.2"
       ```
       Replace `10.0.0.2` with your Wazuh manager's IP address.
   - After installation, start the Wazuh agent service:
     ```cmd
     net start Wazuh
     ```
   - For detailed instructions, refer to the [Wazuh documentation on installing agents on Windows endpoints](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/wazuh-agent/wazuh-agent-package-windows.html).

2. Configure Windows Event Logging for RDP:
   - Ensure that Windows is logging RDP-related events:
     - Logon events are typically recorded under **Event ID 4624** (successful logon) and **Event ID 4625** (failed logon) in the Security log.
   - Verify that these events are being generated when RDP connections occur.

3. Set Up Wazuh to Monitor RDP Events:
   - Wazuh includes built-in rules to detect RDP logon attempts.
   - To customize or add specific rules, edit the `local_rules.xml` file on the Wazuh manager:
     ```xml
     <group name="windows,">
       <rule id="100100" level="5">
         <if_sid>60106</if_sid>
         <field name="win.system.providerName">Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-RemoteConnectionManager</field>
         <description>Terminal Services Remote Connection Manager</description>
       </rule>
     </group>
     ```
     This example rule triggers an alert when the Terminal Services Remote Connection Manager logs an event.
   - After modifying rules, restart the Wazuh manager to apply changes
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager
     ```
   - For more information on configuring custom rules, see the [Wazuh community discussion on monitoring RDP logon events](https://groups.google.com/g/wazuh/c/Gdt47KgTWQo).

4. Verify RDP Monitoring
   - Initiate RDP connections to the Windows endpoint.
   - Check the Wazuh dashboard to confirm that alerts are generated for RDP logon attempts.
   - Ensure that both successful and failed logon attempts are being captured as expected.

these steps, you can effectively monitor RDP logon attempts using Wazuh, enhancing your organization's security posture.
